            <h2>CDI Soul System</h2>
            <p class="cs_p" style="text-align: left">In late 2012, the college offers us a whole new work place called CDI
                (Center for Digital Innovation). After a discussion with my professor and the Dean, we decided to make
                this two-level building a practice of smart space design. As the designer and also the user of this
                project, my team developed CDI Soul System, a smart space system which is able to analyze users’ behavior
                and control the space facilities such as access authority system, in-door temperature and lighting. The
                system also contains a powerful administration web app and various controllers with well-designed
                user interfaces.</p>

                <h2>easy-to-use integrated control</h2>
                <p class="cs_p">From the beginning, we aim to build a better and easier solution based on the user
                    scenarios and experience. A client system including an intuitive access pad and an all-in-one wall
                    controller was deployed over 4 rooms of the space. User will be able to reserve the space, turn on
                    the lights or HVAC system, and even control the curtains quick and simple.</p>

            <p class="cs_p" style="color: black">We integrated various IoT technologies into the system in order to
                make an unified set of APIs for lighting, doors, HVAC and other space facilities. The motivation we were
                doing this is the willing of a powerful and easy-to-use integrated control.</p>

                <h2>Management and energy-saving</h2>
                <p class="cs_p">After the construction of the physical workspace and CDI Soul 1.0, we decided to go further
                    for better management and efficiency of the spaces. We added over 50 new features to the administration
                    system and redesigned the existing interfaces. What’s more, a new automatic control system with energy-saving
                    features and a smart visual instruction system are included.</p>

                Even the background administration system contains over 100 features is well organized with beautiful interfaces.
                I also designed a brand new schedule system and an user authority system for complicated use cases.
                Plus, a vivid customization system of the building information screens is built in the command center
                with clear interface design.</p><br>

                automation. A brand new remote controller that allows users to control the space facilities wherever
                they are is built in the app with clear interface. The controller also enables CDI Soul to detect and
                learn user behaviors for higher efficiency of room usage and energy consumption.</p>

                    and user preferences. For example, turn off the heating system when the room is empty or
                    disable some lights if the indoor brightness is above the standard of the preference setting. The feature guarantees
                    all the facilities running in a proper duration for longer device lifetime and energy efficiency.</p>

                    to more students in the college. This feature offers a dynamic control mechanism, which means all the
                    facilities including the automated door of the specific room that user has reserved will be controllable
                    during the reservation period to the user. The powerful authority system and the scheduling system of
                    CDI Soul 2.0 makes the feature works well without disturb the daily uses of the members.</p>

                system is not only a navigation of the spaces but now with the room schedule and activities information. </p><br>

                <p class="cs_p">When I was designing the digital information system,  I was not only considering about
                    the interface of the display but also the connection with users and the spaces. Despite placing them
                    beside the room doors, we also tried different places that most people would be attracted according
                    to the observation. For instance, info displays built in the mirrors in the restrooms shows the
                    highlight posters and daily activities of all the spaces.</p>

                and new control elements for easier vertical manipulations. Intuitive transitions and animations have
                been enrolled to offer clearer information of the system and more delightful user experience.</p>
